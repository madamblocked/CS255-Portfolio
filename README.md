# CS255-Portfolio

DriverPass is a groundbreaking application integrating a web development environment with meeting driver education training needs. Liam, Product Owner, wanted to ensure that we provided a resource for students to: register for driver education appointments, schedule package classes, and update their profile information. In this project, I felt that I excelled at interpreting technical requirements into non-technical concepts for a wide range of audiences. One thing I would revise is my Gantt Chart. I would have made it a little bit more detailed in terms of timeline. The user's needs are intergral to determine the overall architecture and structure of the software, and it's also how I approach my own software development. The ultimate goal is to just produce a good, beginning iterative version of the software application when the project starts. As the project expands, the software will change but perhaps the overall vision and architecure will be more fully realized.
